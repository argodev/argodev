## About Me

I work in Vulnerability Science and am part of the Cyber Resilience and Intelligence division at the [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/). In my role as a computer science researcher, I work alongside other scientists to deliver solutions to complex problems at a national scale. The group I am part of applies its expertise in software vulnerability detection, analysis, and exploit mitigation to the nationâ€™s most challenging cybersecurity missions. Through its research, the group seeks to push beyond the current boundaries of software vulnerability research. My current research interests include vulnerability analysis, text analysis, machine learning, and embedded systems. Some of my publications can be viewed via my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9002-1440).

Prior to coming to ORNL in 2007, I was a solutions architect for a [high-end consulting firm](https://go-planet.com) where my work included business and systems analysis, provisioning infrastructures for federal, corporate, and service provider environments as well as general application development. I have decades of experience as a professional developer with clients ranging from service providers in Europe and the Far East to corporate and federal customers in the US including spending time as an adjunct member of a Microsoft solutions development team.
